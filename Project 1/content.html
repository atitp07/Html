    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.</p>
    <p>Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.</p>
    <p>There are many types of dogs, each with their own appearance and behavior. Some common types include Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Poodles.</p>
